When I closed the cover after reading The Mockingjay, I felt robbed of a proper resolution. The next day I gave away my copy; equally out of childish frustration and a hope that my able minded friend would confirm my opinions. In the coming months, public perception was as divided as I had anticipated. When the first Hunger Games film came to town, I saw a blockbuster franchise grab a promising foothold that might ramp up to a conclusion that would change my nearly hostile distain for the bookâ€¦ Nope.

A film based on an existing media gets harsher scrutiny. I've never been in a situation where I've willed a film to take free reign from that material and break a few rules. Ultimately, between these two films, it was one of the most dutiful adaptations I have ever seen. From 390 pages of source material, 260 minutes of film were created. This is a stretch for a shot-for-shot adaptation, but it allows for a rare opportunity of faithfulness. This unfortunate scenario delivered a finale that was as authentic as it was disappointing.

Katniss was a relatable character in the first installment, an inspiration in the second, abbreviated in the third, and finally fully plucked of vibrancy by the end. Jennifer Lawrence is shown in close- up for just long enough to get a reaction shot for the first 2 hours. Those reactions never varied from despair or alarm from an explosion. This film was a freight train of war and action steaming toward an end that hardened without smooth edges. This is not to say that the ending wasn't cheerful enough, or too splendid in the face of its preceding tragedies; just shapeless.

Entertaining moments came in early progressions. The most enthralling stretch came when an elite squad was put through an hour long Hunger Games trial in subterranean Panem. While not in any way crucial to the story, it was a satisfying amalgam of elements from World War Z and Maze Runner. Due to this dangerous setting, subsequent events didn't allow for time to look back or provide believable exposition to vary the singular motives of any character. The result was a climax that paled in comparison to rising action, all because of irrelevant motivations from previous films that failed to carry through the flames with our heroine.

There are moments of calculating body counts, years, and material loss. What it lacks is the counterpart. The reward for all the suffering that our victor endures is not promised and denied, it is never offered. Phrases like "A free Panem" or "The death of Snow" are used as propaganda for the characters, but remain ambiguous to us. An ending doesn't require happy compensation for struggle or even consolation. This felt like consolation for a different story and conflict. I imagine that story was glad to be rid of it.
