So here it is at last: 'Mockingjay Part 2' is about to open worldwide and Katniss Everdeen's epic, tragic journey finally comes to an end. The good news: the film is much better than what many "professional" critics give it credit for. But if you're among those who didn't much care for the last film and its politically charged human drama and grim tone, you might want to prepare yourself. While the gut-wrenching conclusion to the Hunger Games saga does bring the action back (although of a far grittier kind than what we saw in the first two films), its tone and themes are a perfect continuation of 'Mockingjay: Part 1'. 

I've never read the books, but I guess I'm in the minority among the non-book-readers, because I actually liked the third film. I liked it precisely for its not primarily action-based narrative and hard hitting portrayal of a fascist system including all its horrific oppression and propaganda tools. And while I had hoped the final instalment in the series would continue to explore the human drama the way 'Mockingjay: Part 1' did, I was not prepared how far Part 2 would exceed my expectations. The emotional impact this film has tops what came before in every conceivable way: 'Mockingjay: Part 2' is a gut punch of a film, and it may very well be the least "popcorny" popcorn film and least likely blockbuster ever to receive that label.

This is supposed to be a spoiler-free review, so I won't go into any story details, but I felt the most impressive thing - especially compared to the beginning of the saga - was how layered 'Mockingjay: Part 2' is. This is not the good-against-evil story anymore: this is a really smart study on how propaganda works and how one fascist system is about to be replaced - albeit with the best intentions - by another. Where the first two movies show how apathy turns into peaceful protest and peaceful protest gives way to open rebellion, the last two films show how that rebellion becomes more and more radical until the lines start to blur. A very wise person once said: "War makes Fascists of us all" - I believe 'Mocking Jay: Part 2' does an excellent job at getting that point across. Apart from the delightfully evil President Snow (who remains a believable character - not a caricature - thanks to Donald Sutherland's performance), there are no mere black and white characters here; instead, we get a story that - for once - hasn't been dumbed down and functions as a sincere and complex exploration of an escalating civil war that threatens to consume everyone. And unlike most YA adaptations, the film doesn't shy away for a second from showing what that means: the audience is left in no doubt about the human toll this revolution will take in the end.

Maybe the current situation in Syria made this film resonate more with me than it should have, but I was surprised at how un-Hollywood-like and really, really well this was done. With its well-drawn characters (portrayed by an outstanding ensemble of actors), credible dialog and a story that takes its time, this felt like so much more than just your usual popcorn movie. And I can't stress this enough: Jennifer Lawrence MAKES this film; the whole franchise, really. The emotional intensity she brings to Katniss feels so real; it's the kind of performance that, in this kind of film, sadly often gets overlooked, but I sincerely doubt a better Katniss could ever have been found (and I hope Lawrence wins her second Oscar for this).

So my final verdict on the film: 'Mockingjay: Part 2' is intelligent entertainment that doesn't have to rely on special effects and one mindless action scene after another. It's a fitting ending to Katniss' journey and a satisfying conclusion to the saga, but it's also a heartbreaking, emotionally exhausting experience that will stay with you long after viewing (even the champagne-fuelled premiere crowd in Berlin was eerily quiet for a short while when the credits started rolling). 8 stars out of 10.
