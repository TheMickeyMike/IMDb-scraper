I tell you what, I went to the cinema right after reading a review on the news that claimed this movie was the most boring Bond movie of the last 30 years. I am sorry to disagree. It's the most boring movie of all time. 

Seriously, this Bond series have got to stop. The character has been squeezed too much and there's no juice left. Everything feels a constant repetition. You can guess the outcome of every scene so easily. If there's a tough guy, he kills him. If there's a hot girl, he has sex with her. If there's any transport around, he will make the craziest stunts with it, while finding the time to kill 10 guys on the way and enjoy some fresh air in the end as if he just had had lunch with his mother. 

Seriously, I won't bother with this joke agent again. Bond may never die, but he's now dead and buried to me.
