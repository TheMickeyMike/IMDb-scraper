This film bored me all the way through. It was a bit like watching a beautiful documentary of a small family living in hut on a lake in Tibet. But, somebody hit the mute button and I'm too lazy to get the remote. So, I'm left to imagine what I'm supposed to be getting out of this movie with my ample time between interesting events and/or plot progression.Imagery yes, story no. It was very Buddhist, but that is all. The plot moved at a snail's pace. The movie went mostly without dialog. It was like a 15 minute comic book had been turned into a full-length movie.All picture no plot. Not as offensive as Twilight though.
